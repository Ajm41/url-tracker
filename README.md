# URL Tracker v 0.1 

Change monitoring app that checks the content of web pages in different periods (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) and detects if they were modified since the last check. It can be used to monitor S3, Azure, JS files, ...etc.   

### Motivation :battery:

* Blog Post: https://ahussam.me/careem-aws-s3-bucket-takeover/


## How to use :arrow_forward:

* Add static content pages (images, JS script, HTML, ...etc) e.g: https://s3.amazonaws.com/[TARGET]/wellcome.html
* The app will fetch the response hash it and store it in the database.
* In case the response changed (S3 bucket got removed, 404 for Github pages, Azure 404, ...etc) You will see the changed links with a red background. 

## Features :ballot_box_with_check:	

  - Login system. 
  - 4 periods checks. 
  - Email reporting.
  - Search in items.
