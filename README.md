Change monitoring app that checks the content of web pages in different periods (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) and detects if they were modified since the last check. It can be used to monitor S3, Azure, JS files, ...etc.   

### Motivation :battery:

* Blog Post: https://ahussam.me/careem-aws-s3-bucket-takeover/


## How to use :arrow_forward:

* If you want to track changes on a web page click add new link button on the right side (You must be logged in): 
  * Fill **description** textbox with any text that describes the target `e.g: Uber internal system login page`.  
  * Write the target link in **Link of page** textbox `e.g: http://s3.amazonaws.com/careemcrm/`. 
  * Write keywords that will be tracked on the page if they appear you will get noticed `e.g: 404, new feature, not found`
  **Note:** They **MUST NOT** be there in the first request. 
  * If you want to track an authenticated page add your cookies in the **cookie** text box.
  * Select the peroid that you want to check the page at.
  * In **tolerance** set the accepted differences between the previous fetch and the next one by characters `e.g: 100`. **Note:** if you
want to ingore minors changes like CSRF tokens, cache tokens, cookie tracking set this parameter. In case you leave it blank the server will ship 2 requests and comapres the differences between them and sets the differences (acceptedChange) in DB. 
  * Then click add link button. You should see the new target in the URLs list. 
  
  
* If you want to get notifications via email: 
   * Create a gmail account. 
   * Go to `User Control > Settings ` then set the gmail account that will send the notificaiton (**DON'T USE YOUR PRIVATE EMAIL**).
   * Write your private email in the **receiver** textbox. 
   * Click save changes button.
